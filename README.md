# Noisy-Labels-Neural-Network
Chainer implementation of "Training Deep Neural-Networks Based on Unreliable Labels."
Note that this is not an official implementation of the paper.

Training of the network runs by

```bash
$ python train.py
```

The result of relabeling noisy training data would look like below.
